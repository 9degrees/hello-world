Walmart is partnering with OpenAI to give shoppers a new feature that lets them complete purchases using ChatGPT, as the retailer invests in artificial intelligence to improve operations. 

Using ChatGPT's new "Instant Checkout" feature, shoppers in conversation with the AI-powered bot will be able to browse Walmart's offerings and complete purchases from within the app.

ChatGPT first announced "Instant Checkout" last month. The shopping feature lets users query ChatGPT for things like "best mattress under $1,000" or "gift for an avid reader," and buy suggested products from within the chat, without having to navigate outside the app.

With the Walmart partnership, the AI-driven shopping experience "allows customers and Sam's Club members to plan meals, restock essentials, or discover new products simply by chatting â€” Walmart will take care of the rest," the retail giant said Tuesday.
